## Format

Some notes on the format used.

### Typography

The body font is Fjord One, used at a size of 9pt and a line spacing of 11pt.

### Page format: 
Width: 4.25 inch
Height: 6.875 inch

### Margins

#### Margins - First version (v1.0):

Inside: 0.72 inch (1.8 cm)
Outside: 0.5 inch (1.27 cm)
Top: 0.7 inch
Bottom: 0.5 inch

The top page numbers and running titles are placed at 0.4166 inch from top.

Evaluation of the print version:

Interior is fine, bottom is fine. 

Outside and top could be smaller, by about 5mm (0.2 inch). 

We want the end result to look a bit more dense, concentrated. Less white space.

#### Margins - Second version (v1.1):

Inside: 0.72 inch
Outside: 0.3 inch 
Top: 0.5 inch
Bottom: 0.4 inch

Top page numbers and running titles are now placed 0.2166 inch from top.

We also increased the size of page number and running titles - same size 
as the body text (9pt).


### TODO:

* delete pages & re-apply new master pages to everything from page 4.
* add the EPFL talk.
