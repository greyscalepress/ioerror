## Format

Some notes on the format used.

### Typography

The body font is Fjord One, used at a size of 9pt and a line spacing of 11pt.

### Page format: 
Width: 4.25 inch
Height: 6.875 inch

### Margins

#### Margins - First version (v1.0):

Inside: 0.72 inch (1.8 cm)
Outside: 0.5 inch (1.27 cm)
Top: 0.7 inch
Bottom: 0.5 inch

The top page numbers and running titles are placed at 0.4166 inch from top.

Evaluation of the print version:

Interior is fine, bottom is fine. 

Outside and top could be smaller, by about 5mm (0.2 inch). 

We want the end result to look a bit more dense, concentrated. Less white space.

#### Margins - Second version (v1.1):

Inside: 0.72 inch
Outside: 0.3 inch 
Top: 0.5 inch
Bottom: 0.4 inch

Top page numbers and running titles are now placed 0.2166 inch from top.

We also increased the size of page number and running titles - same size 
as the body text (9pt).

Note: take care that Page numbers and running titles have more than 0.25 inch margin!

Currently: top box has a position of 0.2166. If we move it to 0.26, we need to add 0.05 
to the top margin (and remove from 0.05 the bottom).

Which will give:

Inside: 0.72 inch
Outside: 0.3 inch
Top: 0.55 inch
Bottom: 0.35 inch

Update (2013.11.11, 11h15)
Use the baseline grid, so left and right page will be correctly aligned.

Baseline settings (Document Setup > Guides)
Baseline Grid: 11pt
Baseline Offset: 38pt (0.55 inch = 39.60 pt)

Make the bottom margin: 0.35 inch

#### Margins - update


#### Monochrome Black

Adding a monochrome black page at beginning and end (inspiration: "Transparence, Opacit√©,
Camouflage", by Samuel Rivers-Moore).


## Cover format

Current page count: 114p.

Spine Width Calculation:
Cream paper: multiply page count by 0.0025"

114 x 0.0025 = 0.285"

Full cover surface (including bleed): 
height: 6.8750 (+ 0.25 bleed = 7.125")
with: 4.25 + 0.285 + 4.25 = 8.785 (+ 0.25 bleed = 9.035")

### TODO:

* delete pages & re-apply new master pages to everything from page 4.
* add the EPFL talk.
